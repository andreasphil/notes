- [**Parse, don't validate.**](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)

- From that same article, the concept of **Shotgun parsing:**

> Shotgun parsing is a programming antipattern whereby parsing and input-validating code is mixed with and spread across processing code. [...] Shotgun parsing necessarily deprives the program of the ability to reject invalid input instead of processing it.

- Learn how to use **modern CSS color features for advanced use cases** like generating color schemes in part 2 of the [Pragmatic Guide to Modern CSS Colors.](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-pragmatic-guide-to-modern-css-colours-part-two/)

- New to the Baseline: the [CookieStore API,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore) a **simpler way of reading and setting cookies.**

- Did you know that you can get most of TypeScript by using [JSDoc comments](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) in plain old JavaScript files? Learn more about the [**nuances of JavaScript typing using JSDoc,**](https://thathtml.blog/2025/12/nuances-of-typing-with-jsdoc/) and check out Svelte for a [case study](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35892250) of why you might want this.

- Woke up to your web service [unexpectedly mining Bitcoin?](https://x.com/duborges/status/1997293892090183772) Perhaps you're affected by the **[10/10 vulnerability](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components) in React Server Components.** If you're curious about the details, check out [the explainer](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1997362942929440937) of this "juxtaposition of a glaring omission of a safety check, combined with a stunningly brilliant mechanism to exploit it."

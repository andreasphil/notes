title: Date pickers, designing URLs, rotting software
---

- **Pikaday,** once a [JavaScript date picker component,](https://github.com/Pikaday/Pikaday) has been relaunched as ["a friendly guide to front-end date pickers"](https://pikaday.dbushell.com/)---a great collection of UI patterns and approaches to tackle this notoriously complicated component with relatively simple building blocks.

- CJ [follows up on "AI coding sucks".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6_e5Mj7Hzw) He shares his thoughts after **not using AI for 30 days,** what he learned about coding and craft, and how he's going to integrate AI into his workflow going forward.

- **CSS Subgrid** is both powerful for layout and at times mystifying. Josh has written an [approachable guide](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/subgrid/) with many interactive examples to help you make sense of it. 

- [Importing JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/with#importing_json_modules_with_the_type_attribute) is now *Baseline Newly Available.* [Jake explains](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/importing-vs-fetching-json/) why you might still want to `fetch` it instead. Read to learn about **caching, memory leaks, and how browsers handle modules.**

- URLs are not just technical descriptors, but also [UI elements](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/urls-are-ui) and application state. Here are some [considerations to help you **design great URLs.**](https://alfy.blog/2025/10/31/your-url-is-your-state.html) (Did you know that our designers in the Portal team are involved in specifying URLs?)

- "The bad news is that [your software is rotting.](https://terminal.ahumanfuture.co/posts/2025-04-19/your-software-is-rotting/) The good news is that there are many simple but powerful things we can do to slow the process to a crawl."

- Some of my recent tasks made me realize how tricky **ARIA landmarks** are. Here's an example: [Header and footer elements change their roles when they're inside of sectioning content](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/header-and-footer-elements-lose-their-roles-in-sectioning-content/) 😬

- Use [error chaining](https://allthingssmitty.com/2025/11/10/error-chaining-in-javascript-cleaner-debugging-with-error-cause/) with the `Error.cause` property in JavaScript to get more **useful stack traces and richer error messages.**

- **Revert changes** made by `commit` to `file` without undoing the entire commit: `git restore --source [commit]^ [path/to/file]`

### Notable releases:

- [**Vitest 4.0,**](https://vitest.dev/blog/vitest-4) featuring stable [browser mode](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/#browser-mode) and [visual regression testing.](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/visual-regression-testing.html) Learn more about browser mode in [this talk from ViteConf.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFYqwXPgJFw)

- [**GitHub Universe,**](https://github.com/events/universe/recap) announcing---unsurprisingly---lots of AI stuff, but also GitHub Code Quality, a competitor to SonarCloud.

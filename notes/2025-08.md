title: State of CSS, debugging Java in VS Code, building software quickly
---

- The results of the [**State of CSS 2025**](https://2025.stateofcss.com/en-US) survey are out. The usual caveats about diversity of respondents etc. apply. Still a good read to find out how people are writing CSS nowadays, and which new features and trends to keep an eye on. The main takeaway:

> It's clear that CSS is no longer ‚Äújust‚Äù a styling language. It has made a fundamental shift in direction, taking on a larger role when it comes to layouts, motion, compatibility, and of course, accessibility. This shift helps redefine CSS‚Äôs identity not as a legacy styling language, but as a modern, expressive toolset that is finally getting the recognition it deserves.

- For a while, I have dreaded **debugging Java with VS Code** because I assumed it would be very complicated to set up. Turns out it's [really quite simple,](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-debugging) and even works for more involved projects with Gradle and Spring Boot (like [Normen](https://github.com/digitalservicebund/ris-norms)). My [mission to replace IntelliJ with VS Code](https://notes.a13i.dev/notes/2025-02/) is now complete üéâ (everything else is still pretty much the same as I reported last time).

- [**SmolCSS**](https://smolcss.dev/), a collection of "minimal snippets for modern CSS layouts and components".

- A while ago, we learned that TypeScript is [being rewritten in Go,](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/) promising much better performance. Now the [**roadmap** is becoming more concrete:](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-9/#what%E2%80%99s-next) TypeScript v6 is going to be a transition release, introducing a few deprecations and smaller changes in behavior. v7 will be the rewritten version.

- [**"How I build software quickly":**](https://evanhahn.com/how-i-build-software-quickly/) spoiler---it only involves a small amount of AI, and lots of setting expectations, iterating, and negotiating requirements.

- The latest beta of [Vitest adds support for **visual regression testing**](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta.4) via the `toMatchScreenshot` assertion.

- You can use [**Git Worktrees**](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree.html) to check out more than one branch at a time. Think of it like cloning the repository multiple times, except that everything will be shared, so it's faster and consumes less disk space. VS Code recently has added [support for Worktrees,](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_103#_git-worktree-support) too.

- The Zed team is hosting [**Agentic Engineering**](https://zed.dev/agentic-engineering), a series of events on making software with AI. While I'm still struggling to find a good workflow for myself personally, their principles sound reasonable to me, and the conversations are interesting.

- **Type stripping in Node is now enabled by default** [from version 22.18.0 onwards.](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.18.0#2025-07-31-version-22180-jod-lts-aduh95) That means we can now run TypeScript directly without any additional configuration! Two caveats: TSX, as well as TypeScript in dependencies, are not supported.

- GitHub's CEO has resigned. As a result, GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft but has so far operated as an independent organization, is now [part of the Core AI team at Microsoft.](https://www.theverge.com/news/757461/microsoft-github-thomas-dohmke-resignation-coreai-team-transition) Will be interesting to see how that's going to shape GitHub going forward. Interesting discussion on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44865560), too.

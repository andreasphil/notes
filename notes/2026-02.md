title: Interop 2026, framework design for AI, keyboard shortcuts
---

- **Interop,** the yearly initiative to align Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on relevant web platform features, has shared their [summary of 2025,](https://webkit.org/blog/17808/interop-2025-review/) as well as their [focus areas for 2026.](https://webkit.org/blog/17818/announcing-interop-2026/) 2025 saw meaningful progress in [Anchor Positioning,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Anchor_positioning) [View Transitions,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) and the [Navigation API.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_API) 2026 promises to bring, among other things, improvements to the CSS `attr()` function, Container Style Queries, dialogs, and popovers (finally native tooltips?!).

- Is React the last JavaScript framework? How do you design frameworks for code that might not be written by humans? Is SSR still a thing? Ryan Carniato, author of [SolidJS,](https://www.solidjs.com/) shares his thoughts on [where JavaScript frameworks are headed in 2026.](https://dev.to/playfulprogramming/javascript-frameworks-heading-into-2026-2hel)

- We're getting a new layout type in CSS: **Grid Lanes,** also known as Masonry. Learn [how it works and when we can expect to use it](https://webkit.org/blog/17758/when-will-css-grid-lanes-arrive-how-long-until-we-can-use-it/)---even if the layout itself doesn't interest you, the post has some food for thought about polyfills and progressive enhancement.

- **Keyboard shortcuts** are an essential feature for accessibility and power users, yet they're surprisingly hard to get right. Here's a [practical guide for adding keyboard shortcuts to web apps,](https://ericwbailey.website/published/how-an-accessibility-designer-adds-keyboard-shortcuts-to-a-web-app/) along with a list of common shortcuts.

- 1Password has an [AWS plugin](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/shell-plugins/aws/) that makes it easy to **securely set `aws` CLI credentials.**

- [WebMCP,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOPhVSeimtI) while still an early draft, offers **a glimpse of what web development might look like in an agentic AI world.** Also see: [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview)

### Notable releases:

- [**ESLint 10.0.0,**](https://eslint.org/blog/2026/02/eslint-v10.0.0-released/) dropping support for Node versions <24 and `.eslintrc`, and introducing a new algorithm for looking up configuration files.

- [**Deno Deploy,**](https://deno.com/blog/deno-deploy-is-ga) now generally available, seems like a good platform to host prototypes and small projects with its simple setup, free database + key value store, and sandboxing.

- [**TypeScript 6 Beta,**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-6-0-beta/) introducing a number of breaking changes and deprecations aimed at promoting better defaults and modern code.

- [**Oxfmt Beta**,](https://oxc.rs/blog/2026-02-24-oxfmt-beta) the code formatter by the Vite team, achieving 100% Prettier compatibility up to 30x faster, with built-in support for Tailwind class sorting and import organization.

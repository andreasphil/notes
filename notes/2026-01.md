title: The web in 2025 and beyond, pre-commit hooks, accessibility checks
---

- 2025 has been another productive year for the web platform. [This recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg8gJz82kZg) covers the big and small features that reached baseline availability, and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YeBQUAjAQM) peers into the crystal ball for 2026.

- The results of the [State of HTML 2025](https://2025.stateofhtml.com/en-US) are in---as always a good source for getting an idea about APIs and patterns that are gaining traction or stay relevant.

- To see some of these in action, check out how to build an [animated, automatically positioned context menu](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/popover-context-menus-with-anchor-positioning/) and [complex page transitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb-RNqiDoiw) with only HTML and CSS.

- [Pre-commit hooks are fundamentally broken](https://jyn.dev/pre-commit-hooks-are-fundamentally-broken/) (personally, I disable them locally in my [lefthook-local.yml](https://lefthook.dev/examples/lefthook-local.html) and rely on our pipeline to discover the occasional issue 🤭):

> Pre-commit hooks are a fundamentally broken idea. Code does not exist in isolation. Commits that are local to a developer machine do not ever go through CI. Commits don't even necessarily mean that that the code is ready to publish. [...] More than that, pre-commit hooks are preventing you from saving your work. There should be a really, really good reason to prevent you from saving your work, and IMO "doesn't pass the test suite" is not that.

- Accessibility is hard to get right because the details are tricky. What helps me is seeing the overarching goals, which, luckily, are not very complicated: [5 accessibility checks to run on every component.](https://zeroheight.com/blog/5-accessibility-checks-to-run-on-every-component/) One of those tricky details is that [ARIA roles can remove their children’s semantics.](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/aria-roles-can-remove-their-childrens-semantics/)

- [Keep your Vitest logs tidy](https://vitest.dev/config/onconsolelog) using `onConsoleLog`.

- Learn [how to use Dev Containers,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPMA9cnpScU) a tool and specification supported by many editors. Dev Containers allow you to run your entire project and related tooling in a Docker-based sandbox, making the setup less dependent on your local machine, and offering (some) protection against malicious dependencies or [coding agents going wild.](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/devcontainer)
